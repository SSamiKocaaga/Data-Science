    "You can describe 10 attributes in detail as:\n",
    "- ***satisfaction_level:*** It is employee satisfaction point, which ranges from 0-1.\n",
    "- ***last_evaluation:*** It is evaluated performance by the employer, which also ranges from 0-1.\n",
    "- ***number_projects:*** How many of projects assigned to an employee?\n",
    "- ***average_monthly_hours:*** How many hours in averega an employee worked in a month?\n",
    "- **time_spent_company:** time_spent_company means employee experience. The number of years spent by an employee in the company.\n",
    "- ***work_accident:*** Whether an employee has had a work accident or not.\n",
    "- ***promotion_last_5years:*** Whether an employee has had a promotion in the last 5 years or not.\n",
    "- ***Departments:*** Employee's working department/division.\n",

However, you must provide the K-means algorithm with information about the number of clusters it will make predictions. Also, the data you apply to the K-means algorithm must be scaled. In order to find the optimal number of clusters, you are asked to use the ***Elbow method***. Briefly, try to predict the set to which individuals are related by using K-means and evaluate the estimation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is ready to be applied to the model, you must ***split the data into train and test***. Then build a model to predict whether employees will churn or not. Train your models with your train set, test the success of your model with your test set. \n",

You can use the related modules of the ***scikit-learn*** library. You can use scikit-learn ***Confusion Metrics*** module for accuracy calculation. You can use the ***Yellowbrick*** module for model selection and visualization.\n",

    "#### Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to feature scaling while others are virtually invariant to it. Machine learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, etc. that use gradient descent as an optimization technique require data to be scaled. Also distance algorithms like KNN, K-means, and SVM are most affected by the range of features. This is because behind the scenes they are using distances between data points to determine their similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling Types:\n",
    "- Normalization: Normalization is a scaling technique in which values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. It is also known as Min-Max scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardization: Standardization is another scaling technique where the values are centered around the mean with a unit standard deviation. This means that the mean of the attribute becomes zero and the resultant distribution has a unit standard deviation.\n",

    "#### The Elbow Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Elbow Method\" can be used to find the optimum number of clusters in cluster analysis. The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters in k-means clustering. The elbow method plots the value of the cost function produced by different values of k. If k increases, average distortion will decrease, each cluster will have fewer constituent instances, and the instances will be closer to their respective centroids. However, the improvements in average distortion will decline as k increases. The value of k at which improvement in distortion declines the most is called the elbow, at which we should stop dividing the data into further clusters.\n",

This gives us a holistic view of how well our classification model is performing and what kinds of errors it is making.\n",

Model Deployement helps you showcase your work to the world and make better decisions with it. But, deploying a model can get a little tricky at times.

Streamlit is a popular open source framework used by data scientists for model distribution.\n",

Only when a model is fully integrated with the business systems, real values ​​can be extract from its predictions.\n",
